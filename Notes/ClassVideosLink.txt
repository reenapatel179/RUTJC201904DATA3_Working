# Mongo Class
## Instructions
* Use the command line to create a ClassDB database
* Insert entries into this database for yourself and the people around you within a collection called students
* Each document should have a field of name with the person's name, a field of favoriteLibrary for the person's favorite Python library, a field of age for the person's age, and a field of hobbies which will hold a list of that person's hobbies.
* Use the find() commands to get a list of everyone of a specific age before using name to collect the entry for a single person.

* It would be good to Modify the app so that when the record is entered, the current date and time is automatically inserted into the document.
* Hint: consult the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) on the datetime library.

# A Soup Starter
## Instructions
* Believe it or not, CNN's website for **1996: Year in Review** is still alive on the web: <http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/>
* We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.
* Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:
1. The **title**
2. All **paragraph** texts
3. The top 10 headlines (warning: this one is a bit tricky, and may not come out perfectly!)
## Hints
* For the third task, you will need a means of filtering the data, perhaps over multiple iterations.
## Bonus
* If you finish early, head over to the [Beautful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read up on accessing attributes and navigating the DOM.

Data Warehouses are not the only things that use ETL programs. This is real world example of what an ETL is used for (I know it is a one of kind example but there are other unique examples out there - its just that this one was built by me). This ETL was used to grab image data from cameras, size data from a real mat cutting machine, price data csvs, mat color csvs and put them into a custom web optimized image database and transform script. This kind of image transformation script would not have happened if it were not for ETL.

In this open-ended activity, students will use their Tableau skills to explore data and create visualizations.
Students will work in pairs or groups of three.
They must use at least two data sources.
They may use their previous group projects for inspiration. However, they should not simply replicate their old projects in Tableau.
When working with data, they may need to clean it with a tool like Pandas before bringing it into Tableau.
They will give a brief (3-5 minutes) presentation to the class with a summary of their visualizations and findings.

Output of graphviz for decision tree instruction activity

anyone that wants to try it on their machine, you'll need to access environment variables, and add the path graphviz is installed in.
The path I added for example is: C:\Users\mtoriello0725\Anaconda3\envs\PythonData\Library\bin\graphviz
